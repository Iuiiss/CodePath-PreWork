## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
For this assignment I didn't really have any help other than the instructions provided. I struggled a bit to export the project into my github but I figured it out fairly quickly.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I must say that I found getting used to these new languages very challenging. This is my first year of programming and I’ve only been practicing in java. So the thought process and the way these two languages differ confused me a lot. This was my first time coding in these languages and it was a very successful experience and I was very proud of myself for being able to understand how everything functioned with some guidance of course. It’s very organized, structured, and quite difficult at first. I overcame this challenge by translating or finding the alternative in the language I know, java. I quickly learned that by doing this things started to make sense. I started to understand what each thing was and how it worked since I knew their function in java. Methods and stating variables are much less confusing and more straightforward in html and css vs. java since types don’t seem to be too much of a hassle. There are a lot of similarities between java and the languages I worked with during this project. The way methods are set up, or using methods on variables, etc. It felt new but it was a comfortable type of new if that makes sense. I will definitely keep working with these languages and learn more about them. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If this is how websites are made, I wonder how more complex web pages are designed and made? I’m referring to websites with moving backgrounds, or buttons that you hover over and they split or get bigger, things related to this. I’m certain that it has to do with an animation method but I’m just wondering how the design process would be for a project of that caliber. I also wonder if web development is harder or easier than software engineering. Right now I’m focusing more on software development but I would also love to learn more about web development. One last question I have is how does software development and web development connect? How can these two different ways of designing can be implemented together or unified?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would totally love to understand more about the structure of everything. I would like to learn more about the audio functionality we used and how everything works and ties together. I tried adding one more button with its distinct tone but I couldn’t figure how to do it correctly. For some reason when I added an extra button, the clueSequence would light it up and it would remain lit up. I couldn’t figure out how to fix this issue, so I discarded it. Another thing I was fascinated about was the add and hide functionality. How easily their states could change from hidden to present. Nevertheless, there are many topics here that I would love to learn more about and master about this project. I loved how simple and easy it was to create this very interesting game and the potential to make it so much better is there, but I don’t have the knowledge to accomplish that yet.
